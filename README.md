# GeekWisdom Tool Documentation

## What are the Tools?

GeekWisdom is a set of programming tools 'components' designed to make 
programming easier regardless of what langugage you choose to use

These tools were inspired from an idea I had back in 2012. At that time I was
heaving into 'Enterprise Architeture', specifically TOGAF. I became fascinated
as I read about 'building blocks'. Architecture Building Blocks (ABB) and 
solution building blocks (SBB).

This got me thinking about a standard set of building blocks or 'components' 
that could be implemenented in any language using a common interface, and the gwTools were born

## Features

* All GeekWisdom components fall under the org.geekwisdom namespace
* The components are designed to simplify common programming tasks with a consistant interface across programming languages
* The components can be implemented in any OO language
* Currently you can use the in JAVA, .NET/MONO, and PHP
* Allows you to easily port code from one language to another as well as make
'on-the-fly' changes to underlying infrastructure (eg: databases) via configuration files vs code
