# GeekWisdom Tool Documentation

## GWSettings: GeekWisdom Settings Coomponent

### Overview

GeekWisdom is a set of programming tools 'components' designed to make 
programming easier regardless of what langugage you choose to use

These tools were inspired from an idea I had back in 2012. At that time I was
heaving into 'Enterprise Architeture', specifically TOGAF. I became fascinated
as I read about 'building blocks'. Architecture Building Blocks (ABB) and 
solution building blocks (SBB).

This got me thinking about a standard set of building blocks or 'components' 
that could be implemenented in any language using a common interface, and the gwTools were born
